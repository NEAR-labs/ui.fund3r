While you should provide clear details of your project timelines and scope, an application with lengthy responses is not necessarily preferable! We read through many submissions, so if you can concisely convey your ideas, we would greatly appreciate it. All applications will be received and reviewed on a rolling basis. Only one application per individual and/or team can be submitted at a time.<br><br>After completing your projectâ€™s pre-specified milestones, an individual or team can re-apply for another grant. Grants are issued in NEAR tokens but payment methods such as USD/ EUR can be issued in exceptional circumstances.",
